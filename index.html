        <h1>CANBERRA'S ART BIENNIAL</h1>
        <h2>Contour 556 returns for the 4th edition in October 2022.</h2><br>


        <p>Canberra’s Art Biennial comprises core installations around the central lake landscape (contour 556), as well as an expanded presence in Canberra City/City Hill. Artists will be responding to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia’s political, cultural and physical history. We have consolidated our support with locals and others around Australia through a successful fundraising event concluded in June 2021. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting, puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space. </p><br>
