In this first project in which we were required to create a responsive website, the initial process comprised of research, inspirations, tutorial demonstrations, and implementing. The first steps within the research consisted of looking at websites and their attributes, what types elements were visible, whether their interface was user-friendly, etc. After this process, I decided upon what style of website I wanted to create, as well as consider how to narrow down the content from the original Contour556 website. In this process, I filtered through the website and extracted what was the important information and other elements that would add interest to the site. In terms of user experience, I thought that the original website had an extensive amount of unnecessary content that would give the viewer information / content overload. In saying this, I opted for a very minimal design that would provide only the important information such as the dates, locations, event organisers, as well as images that would spark curiousity about the festival event. The prototyping phase consisted of both low-fidelity and high fidelity. I decided to create a high fidelity protoype version as it allowed me to fully visualise the website content and provide a sense of preview of the end product. 

The implementation of the actual structure and styling through html and css was a lot more difficult to navigate in comparison to how minimal I thought my design was. In the development process, the html part of the construction was the easier part of the process, on the other hand, although I looked forward to the styling of the content, it was the most tedious as I've come to discover that there are several ways to do one thing. The process of developing phase was more of a trial and error, as a beginner that is still navigating around interpreting the different tags, attributes and such, I've come to find that this was the more challenging part. Another challenging part of this project was the little details; paying attention to the different units and properties as I always got used to the 'px', as I later found out the conversion rates for pixels to 'em', I applied it more. 

One of the biggest challenge that I encountered was time management. I found that I was spending too much time on a section as I pretty much kept on trialling different ways and starting over laying out a section how I wanted it to be viewed. I was not able to complete the multiple page links that I planned to make thus only completing and finalising the homepage. The overall time management throughout this whole project was very poor, hopefully for the next project I would be able to create a project plan so that I could adhere to the time blocks and complete the different tasks and achieve the right requirements for the website. 

Overall, creating this website was definitely a challenge from having to translate the initial design from just a visual to an actual html/css responsive website. Although it was challenging, it gave me a sense of satisfaction whenever I could create a section in reference to my prototypes. The things I would do differently for the next project is definitely in the area of time management; creating a project timeline where each task is layed out and allocated a time completion so that I can utilise and maximise the time spent on each part of the website and whole project.
